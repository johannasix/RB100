## Introduction

### Computer Science and Layers of Abstraction
• Abstraction: ensures that users are far removed from what's happening "under the hood"
• Users -> Interact with applications -> programmers built the application in Ruby -> written in C -> translates to Assembly language -> translates to machine language -> translates to 0s and 1s that the computer understands
• Domain Specific Languages (DSL): higher level language, ex: Rails
• Interface: what users interact with
